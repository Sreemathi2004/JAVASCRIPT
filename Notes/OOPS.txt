OOP is a programming language model/style organized around objects rather then "actions"
and data rather then logic

Javascript is a versatile and dynmaic programming language that supports multiple paradigms,including procedural,functional and oops.While js is not a purely oo language like java and c++, it provides the tools and features to implement oop concepts effectively.

OOP in js refers to the practice of designing and struturing code objects and their interactions.

It is a programming paradigms that allows developers to model real- world entities and their relationships using objects and classes.

//--------------------------KEYWORD-------------------------

the Javascript this KEYWORD refers to the object it belongs to . it has different values depending on where it is used 

In a method ---> this refers to the owner object.

Alone       ---> this refers to the global object.

In a function ---> this refers to the global object.


console.log(this);//it gives window object
console.log(this===window); true 

window.firstName="sree";
this.lastName="mathi";


---------------------------------------
const obj={
    firstName : "Huxn",
    lastName  : "WebDev",
    fullName : function(){
        //return this; //owner obj

        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
};
console.log(obj.fullName());


if we use ()=> {} arrow function there this direclty refers to windows object it doesnt refer current object


const obj={
    firstName : "Huxn",
    lastName  : "WebDev",
    fullName : ()=>return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    
};
console.log(obj.fullName());
